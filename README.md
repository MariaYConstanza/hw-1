 # Description

Marketing agency wants to optimized the codebase thats still accessible through the search engine.
  
  -Codebase is outdated and should get updated to something more understandable.
  -The solution is removing "divs'" throughtout the codebase and provide semantic elements thats logical to the structure.
  
 # Usage
  
  -div class=header can be replaced as header header; This method of semantic element can elimate the extra steps of "div =class".
  All other div's can be changed to header, section, nav, and footers for logical structure.
